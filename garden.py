# Description: Program takes user name and preferred turtle color and then sets user free to meander around a flower-filled garden as a turtle using the arrow keys. Once user is done, they press 'x' on the keyboard and the number of steps is displayed. Once they press enter to end, their info is written to the leaderboard and is then sorted to be displayed the next time the game is started up.
